# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Classification

This is to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and a Random Forest classifier is used to build the model.

## Requirements

Python 3 <br>
Jupyter Notebook <br>
scikit-learn <br>
Matplotlib (for visualization) <br>

## Installation

We can install the required packages using pip

*pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn ucimlrepo*

## Random Forest model

To clone this model
git clone https://github.com/anjuannsunny/AIDI2004.git

Main branch: Random Forest classifier <br>
Branch 'newbranch': SVM

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is fetched from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using the ucimlrepo package. The dataset contains features that describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the breast cancer biopsy specimens.
